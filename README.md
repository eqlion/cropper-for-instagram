# cropper-for-instagram

This ~~little~~ itty-bitty tiny teeny little python script lets you split your panorama image into parts suitable for posting on Instagram in one post.

# Usage

Just download the script and execute it in the following way:

```
./cropper.py [name of your panorama, should be placed in the same directory]
```
or
```
./oop_cropper.py [name of your panorama, should be placed in the same directory]
```
if you prefer the other one (it doesn't really matter, as both produce the same result)

After that the script will ask you about the way of cropping your photo:

* Auto (will select the best possible way)
* Square (will create square images cutting off excess pixels from both sides)
* Square (will create square images adding white stripes to both sides)
